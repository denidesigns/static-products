                <p>Don’t be fooled by the amazing beachside location - this is not a tourist trap like the surrounding
                    restaurants. Can Fisher specialises in seafood with a particular focus on paella. This place has a
                    great vibe on the weekend; both locals and tourists book way ahead to secure their spot in the sun
                    and wash down their famous dishes with local wines. The prices are considerably higher than the
                    average restaurant in the area, but you are paying for the freshest seafood Barcelona can offer and
                    amazing service.</p>

                <p>The green spot isn’t your average vegetarian restaurant - it’s the best vegetarian restaurants in
                    Spain and 28th best vegetarian in the world! The space is modern with a stylish natural aesthetic,
                    which matches their contemporary take on plant-based dishes. They also serve amazing cocktails which
                    distinguishes them from your typical vegetarian cafe. Don’t miss their famous sweet potato
                    tagliatelle with truffle macadamia sauce!

                <p>This is probably the fanciest chicken rotisserie you will ever visit. Chez coco specialises in roast
                    chicken - just pick your favourite seasoning, sauce, and sides and you’re set for one of the best
                    poultry meals in town. The interior and crowd is upscale; the wine list is impeccable. For a more
                    casual visit, they have a trendy yet relaxed backyard with live music and an Aperol spritz bar
                    during the summer season. You are pretty much guaranteed to be surrounded by only locals at this
                    spot.
